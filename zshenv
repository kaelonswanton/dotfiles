# DOCS: This is read first and read every time, regardless of the shell being
# login, interactive, or none. This is the recommended place to set environment
# variables needed on every shell, even the ones launching scripts
#
# NOTE: Why would you need this? Because, for example, if you have a script that
# gets called by launchd, it will run under non-interactive non-login shell, so
# neither .zshrc nor .zprofile will get loaded.
#
# .zshenv → .zprofile → .zshrc → .zlogin → .zlogout
