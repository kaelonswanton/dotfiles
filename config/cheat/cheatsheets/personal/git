# Start by creating a new feature branch with your initials at the end
git create-branch some-feature-nt

# Work on the branch and rebase when the branch you staged off changes
git rebase -i origin/master

# While rebasing you want to resolve conflicts.
# To take the version of the file from master
git checkout origin/master path/to/file

# Open a PR on Github and fill out a summary, close any issues, etc
#
# Once the PR is merged you can delete your branch
git delete-branch some-feature-nt
# Or if you wanted to keep that branch going, rebase on top of the merge
git rebase -i origin/master
git push
